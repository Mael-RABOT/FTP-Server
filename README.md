            NOOP <CRLF>                   : Do nothing

            (the following are commands using data transfer )

            RETR <SP> <pathname> <CRLF>   : Download file from server to client

            LIST [<SP> <pathname>] <CRLF> : List files in the current working directory

## Creating a user

    ./create_user.sh

The script will ask for a username and a password and will add it in the login.txt file.<br>
The password will automatically be hashed using the XOR algorithm. (it is not secure at all, it is just an example)
